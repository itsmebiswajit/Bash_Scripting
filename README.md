   
<h2>Objective:</h2>
   
Write a suite of Bash scripts to automate system maintenance tasks such as backup, system updates, and log monitoring.


<h3><u>Core Features:</u></h3>

1. Backup System

<ul><li>Creates compressed backups with rotation (keeps last 3)</li>
<li>Supports home directory or custom paths</li></ul>


2. Update & Clean<br>
<ul><li>Automated package updates (apt/dnf)</li>
<li>Cleans cache and temporary files</li></ul>


3. <u>Log Monitor</u>
<ul><li>Real-time error tracking in system logs</li>
<li>Customizable monitoring duration
</li></ul>


4. Disk Check
<ul><li>Disk usage analysis</li>
<li>Large file identification</li></ul>


5. System Info
<ul><li>OS, kernel, CPU, memory details</li>
<li>Uptime and basic diagnostics</li></ul>



<h3>LSP Concepts Used:</h3>
File system operations (tar, rm, mkdir)
Process management (timeout, grep)
System monitoring (/proc, logs, disk)
Package manager integration


<h3>Use Cases:</h3> System maintenance, health checks, learning Linux programming


<h3>Requirements:</h3> Linux OS with standard utilities and sudo access
